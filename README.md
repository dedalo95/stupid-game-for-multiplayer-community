# 🍏 AppleAle Ninja - A Fruit Ninja Tribute in React

Welcome to **AppleAle Samurai** – the **most unnecessary**, yet **most essential** game tribute ever made! 🍏⚔️

This is a **silly** yet **glorious** **Fruit Ninja clone**, built in **React**, as a tribute to the **Multiplayer.it community** and especially to the legendary moderator **AppleAle**.  
Like a true **samurai**, AppleAle slices through nonsense comments with precision and honor—just like in Fruit Ninja! 🥷

## 🎮 Gameplay
- Fruits? **No.**
- Comments? **Yes.**
- A fearless moderator with a katana? **Absolutely.**
  
In **AppleAle Ninja**, you wield the sacred **Mod-Katana** and must **slash** through **toxic comments** while avoiding innocent ones.  
Will you achieve the **ultimate moderator enlightenment**, or will the trolls overwhelm you? 🏆🔥

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React** (because why not?)
- **CSS Magic™** (just vibes)
- **Canvas API** (to make the slicing juicy)
- **Absolute Chaos** (our secret ingredient)
